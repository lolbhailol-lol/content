## For AI Agents

When working with CrwdCtrl context:

1. **Product capabilities**: Only reference features documented in the codebase (see PROJECT_AUDIT.md)
2. **Categories**: Four hubs — Fests (cultural/technical/sports), Sports (run clubs, marathons, sport clubs incl. gymkhana), Treks (+ trek communities), Events (cultural shows: plays, standup, improv, dance drama). Plus Competitions under fests.
3. **Target users**: College students, organizers, trek/run communities
4. **Tech stack**: React 19, Express 5, MongoDB, Cashfree, Firebase, Capacitor (Android)
5. **Business model**: 3% platform fee on paid registrations
6. **Stage**: Pre-seed/MVP, founder-led, campus-focused
7. **Geography**: India, starting with Pune (MIT-WPU)

**Critical accuracy notes:**

- "Theatre" was renamed to "Events" — do not refer to a separate Theatre product.
- There is **no gym-community type** (gymkhana is a sport club). Don't claim "gym communities" as a feature.
- There is **no social feed/follow/comments/DM system** — only favorites and sharing.
- **Don't invent features not in the codebase. Don't claim metrics not documented. Don't exaggerate capabilities.**
